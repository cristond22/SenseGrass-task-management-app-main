# Task Management App
 This is a full-stack MERN Project.I created a simple Task Management System, which allows users to manage their tasks by performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The system consists of a front-end interface built with React.js (for MERN), a back-end API built with Node.js and Express.js, and a database for data storage (MongoDB for MERN). Requirements for this Project: User Interface: Created a task creation page where users can enter details such as task title, description, and due date. Implemented a task listing page that displays all the tasks in a tabular format, including task title, description, due date, and status. Provided options to sort and filter tasks based on their due dates and status. Implemented a task detail page that shows the tasks information and allows editing and deletion. API Endpoints: Created API endpoints for task creation, fetching all tasks, fetching a specific task, updating a task, and deleting a task. Implemented token-based authentication for securing the API endpoints. Used appropriate HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) for each endpoint. Database: Used MongoDB for MERN as the database to store task information. Designed a task schema (MongoDB) with fields for title, description, due date, status, and any other necessary fields. Ensured proper indexing and validation for the task schema (MongoDB). Security: Implement password hashing and salting techniques to securely store user passwords. Used JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization of API endpoints. Validated and sanitized user input to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
